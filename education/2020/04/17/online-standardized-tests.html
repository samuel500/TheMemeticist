<p>From <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/sat-and-act-plan-at-home-college-admissions-exams-during-health-crisis/629182">EdSource</a>.</p>

<p>I am very skeptical of this move. Online education has enormous promise, and I think that it will ultimately replace the vast majority of in-person education. Notwithstanding the bad experience of many students who, because of COVID-19, have to endure an improvised online version of their previously in-person classes.</p>

<p>However, testing and credentialing will probably not make that transition anytime soon. The problem is that the more a test matters and is important for a student’s future, the greater the incentive to cheat. And the stakes of the SAT are (or appear to be) quite high. With a great enough incentive, no software or digital monitoring will prove good enough to prevent cheating.</p>

<p>A webcam and a microphone will never provide enough information of the surrounding environment. And if Apple hasn’t found a way to stop people from jailbreaking their devices, and video game creators haven’t figured out a reliable way to prevent people from pirating their games, the idea that anyone is going to come up with a software solution to ensure the integrity of online tests seems laughable.</p>

<p>This is also why I think that anyone wanting to create a degree-equivalent standardized test (as I argue for <a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/02/05/what-i-learned-dropping-out-of-high-school.html">here</a> and <a href="https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/04/10/pinker-on-education.html">here</a>), will have to stick to in-person test proctoring. At least if they want their test to carry a high signaling value. That also explains to some extent why online degree programs haven’t been more popular, and are viewed with some skepticism by employers.</p>

<p>The future of learning is on the internet, but credentialing will probably remain offline.</p>
