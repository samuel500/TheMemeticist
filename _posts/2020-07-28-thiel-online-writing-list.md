This 100 page document has recently made the rounds: [*Thiel on Progress and Stagnation*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zao_AyBhNb8TPWrQqgXn5NzNAgfEqzTIaFYos7wdqGI/edit#). Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel's online writings were absent from the references section. Maybe the creators of the document left those out on purpose, but I suspect they might just not have been aware of them. A lot of Thiel's online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven't been able to find a good list that includes all of them. So here is a list of everything Peter Thiel has *written online*, as far as I'm aware of:
