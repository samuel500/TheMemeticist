I currently have a piece in the pipeline that follows up on my [previous post](https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/02/05/what-i-learned-dropping-out-of-high-school.html). In it I offer a vision of what higher education could be like, I describe what I have been doing since dropping out of college, and I announce a project that would put my ideas into practice. However, the coronavirus situation has put my plans on hold for now. So you will probably get to read that piece once the circumstances are more auspicious to a project that involves getting people physically together.
	
Though I might still reconsider, and post it before any of my ideas can feasably, or advisably, be put into practice. If there is anyone out there who is particularly curious about what I’ve been up to, or what I’m planning, you can DM me on Twitter, and I’ll share my draft with you. 

In the meantime, I hope to make the most of the quarantine. In the coming weeks and months, I want to work on a post that examines the role that educational institutions should play, from a societal and civilizational perspective. Some of the key ideas that motivate this line of inquiry are contained in a 1995 book by Neil Postman, [*The End of Education*](https://www.amazon.com/End-Education-Redefining-Value-School/dp/0679750312), and in a piece in The Atlantic by Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen from last year: [*We Need a New Science of Progress*](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/). 
	
Postman’s key insight is that the purpose of education is in fact just as important, if not more important, than the method (more on this [here](https://thememeticist.com/education/2020/04/06/end-of-education.html)). This rings very true to me, since in my own learning, progress seems to have been greatest when I intrisically valued my learning, and found it meaningful. In my experience, the financial cost of the education seems to have no effect on the speed or quality of learning. In a world in which student debt in the US stands at more than $1.6 Trillion, this is quite a striking observation.

So while I have a good idea of how education should work, I now want to answer the question of why. To help me with this, I have created reading list of books, papers and blog posts that I plan to go through in the coming weeks and months. Here it is:
